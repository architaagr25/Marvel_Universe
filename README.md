## React + Vite Setup

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for a fast and modern development experience.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## ESLint Configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enabling type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TypeScript template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate `typescript-eslint` in your project.
